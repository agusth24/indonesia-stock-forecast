# Stock price forecasting in Indonesia stock exchange using deep learning: a comparative study
We present a methodology for comparing the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN), gated recurrent units (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), and graph convolutional networks (GCN) layers. The four layers types combination yields 11 architectures with two layers stacked maximum, and the architectures are performance compared in stock price predicting. The dataset consists of open, highest, lowest, closed price, and volume transactions and has 2,588,451 rows from 727 companies in Indonesia Stock eXchange (IDX).

Accepted paper in the International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE).
